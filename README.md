The orange fish (Nemo) bounces around the screen, and the blue fish (Dory) wraps when she reaches the edge. The shark (Bruce) is on a timer, and he occasionally appears in a random spot. When Nemo comes near Bruce, Bruce eats Nemo and briefly displays a "Yum!" text box, before disappearing. When Bruce leaves, Nemo reappears, and the timer restarts.
